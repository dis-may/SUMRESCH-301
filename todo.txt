## Thurs
1. Figure out why bicep and tricep motors are inverted
2. What range of values for the two motors do not go beyond the physiological limits (e,g, 20 < theta < 180 degrees)
3. plot the limits (soft) 

next meeting Tues 1-2pm 
probably not in Thurs next week
Mon and wed most likely to be in

17 Dece,ber leave

## Tues 9 Dec
1. initial positions vary
2. implement a feedback system / controller
3. maybe make a table about the differences between vehicles and this
4. look at how varying k can vary how quickly the arm returns to equilibrium
5. write an email to the authors to see if the model is correct
